# AI-ML-Portfolio
## Professional Bio
I’m an aspiring Data Analyst passionate about transforming data into meaningful insights that drive smarter decisions. My background integrates data analytics, visualization, and a growing focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning .

I enjoy exploring how emerging technologies can be used to streamline processes and contribute to better, real-world applications in industries such as: education, business analytics, and automation. I have acquired skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and AWS, which has instilled confidence in working with data, from extraction to data visualization and reporting.

Right now, I'm advancing my subject matter knowledge of AI-enabled analytics—focused on utilizing intelligent systems to analyze data trends in order to aid in decision-making.

## My Personal Value Proposition
I provide a strong combination of technical skills, analytic mind, and ability to articulate the insights. I can tidy, assemble, and visualize data, but the difference I bring is communicating and generating meaning, from technical concepts to what matters to both technical and non-technical audiences.

I am best at linking data trends to strategic goals--I serve as the intermediary between raw data and meaningful decisions. I also want analytics to be understandable, actionable, and human-centered outcomes.

## Artifact 1: The History of Artificial Intelligence - From Logic to Deep Learning 
### Overview 
This artifact is a timeline presentation using a visual, research-based, format to represent the evolution of Artificial Intelligence from the era of symbolic AI in the 1950s to today's era of deep learning and generative AI. It discusses and highlights significant historical points, AI's dark ages ("AI Winters"), as well as that which has contributed to the outcome of current AI.

The intent of this project was to illustrate a sophisticated engagement with AI’s past—the challenges it faced, the advancement it has made, and the promise it holds for the future—while also displaying this information in a clear and professional manner.

## My Role
I investigated the most significant events in history regarding AI, synthesized patterns of innovation across decades, and created a PowerPoint timeline presentation that was visually appealing, engaging, and easy to follow.

Beyond technical innovations, I wanted to point out the learning that occurred at each stage of AI’s development. For example, while setbacks like AI winters were greatly unfortunate at the times, an important lesson was learned about how to integrate stronger, data-driven and evidential understand approaches early on in AI’s development.

## Technologies and Tools are used
  Microsoft PowerPoint – for our design and presentation
  ChatGPT (OpenAI) – for some structural refinements
  Research: IBM Research, Stanford AI Lab Archives, OpenAI Blog, NVIDIA Research Publication

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Summarizing/analyzing complex technical text with historical relevance
- Using visuals for organization and audience facilitation
- Familiarity with the historical trajectory and advanced state of the practice in artificial intelligence and its development path of creating expert systems.
- Translating technical knowledge to a non-technical audience
  
## Conclusion:
The overriding narrative of the presentation is that there has been a clear path of AI development, informed first by the prior histories of symbolic logic and expert systems, then deep learning methods, to finally generate models, as we can see today.
Since this project worked as an example, I am confident in the ability to demonstrate these skills and demonstrate integrating technical knowledge, critical analysis skills, and design skills into communication and education. I'm confident to transfer these and other skills into a professional context in analytics or AI development.
